Title: Support Spyder Development
Slug: support

Spyder will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the MIT license. But while the whole team does its best to work efficiently, and we actively try to find funding from multiple sources, the reality is that we have limited resources and this fact hinders our development capabilities.

If you have found Spyder to be useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps!

All donations will be used strictly to fund IPython development, by supporting tasks such as developer sprints, better installers, improved documentation and paying for hosting costs for services such as the IPython Notebook Viewer.

Our donations are managed by the NumFOCUS foundation, which passes 100% of your contribution to the Spyder project. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if you are subject to US Tax law, your contributions will be tax-deductible.
